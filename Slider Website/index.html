              Sven is a rogue knight, half-Meranth by birth. After his father
              was executed for violating the Vigil Codex, Sven's mother passed
              away, leaving him an orphan. Tightly bound to his own personal
              code of honor, Sven is a solitary warrior who wields the legendary
              Outcast Blade to devastating effect. He travels alone, searching
              for honor and glory, while acquiring substantial gold as a
              freelance swordsman.

              Yurnero the Juggernaut, named after the martial tradition that he
              swore to preserve and protect, is the last of his masked kind who
              drowned beneath the waves that deluged the ancient Isle of Masks.
              While his inanimate mask bears no readable expressions, each
              motion of his blade arm is an expression of a lost art that yearns
              to be remembered, and every ritual that he casts alone is but a
              shadow of the Isle's once lively and rich traditions. No one has
              ever seen the face hidden beneath the mask of Yurnero the
              Juggernaut.

              The sibling rivalries between Lina the Slayer, and her younger
              sister Rylai, the Crystal Maiden, were the stuff of legend in the
              temperate region where they spent their quarrelsome childhoods
              together. Lina always had the advantage, however, for while
              Crystal was guileless and naive, Lina's fiery ardor was tempered
              by cleverness and conniving. The exasperated parents of these
              incompatible offspring went through half a dozen homesteads,
              losing one to fire, the next to ice, before they realized life
              would be simpler if the children were separated. As the oldest,
              Lina was sent far south to live with a patient aunt in the blazing
              Desert of Misrule, a climate that proved more than comfortable for
              the fiery Slayer. Her arrival made quite an impression on the
              somnolent locals, and more than one would-be suitor scorched his
              fingers or went away with singed eyebrows, his advances spurned.
              Lina is proud and confident, and nothing can dampen her flame

              Lanaya, the Templar Assassin, came to her calling by a path of
              curious inquiry. Possessed of a scientific bent, she spent her
              early years engaged in meticulous study of nature's laws â€” peering
              into grimoires of magic and alchemy, recreating experiments from
              charred fragments of the Violet Archives, and memorizing
              observations of the Keen recordkeepers. Already quiet and
              secretive by nature, the difficulty of acquiring these objects
              further reinforced her skills of stealth.

              The western forests guard their secrets well. One of these is
              Lyralei, master archer of the wood, and favored godchild of the
              wind. Known now as Windranger, Lyralei's family was killed in a
              storm on the night of her birth--their house blown down by the
              gale, contents scattered to the winds. Only the newborn survived
              among the debris field of death and destruction. In the quiet
              after the storm, the wind itself took notice of the lucky infant
              crying in the grass. The wind pitied the child and so lifted her
              into the sky and deposited her on a doorstep in a neighboring
              village. In the years that followed, the wind returned
              occasionally to the child's life, watching from a distance while
              she honed her skills. Now, after many years of training,
              Windranger fires her arrows true to their targets. She moves with
              blinding speed, as if hastened by a wind ever at her back. With a
              flurry of arrows, she slaughters her enemies, having become,
              nearly, a force of nature herself.
